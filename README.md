(Start and end times are fictional, but the best lap times are true). Data contains only the first 20 minutes that refers to the first stage of the qualification.

Q1: For the first 20 minutes (Q1), all cars together on the track try to set the fastest time. The slowest seven cars are eliminated, earning the bottom grid positions. Drivers are allowed to complete as many laps as they want during this short space of time.

> python report.py --files <folder_path> [--asc | --desc]  shows list of drivers and optional order (default order is asc)

> python report.py --files <folder_path> --driver “Sebastian Vettel”  shows statistic about driver
